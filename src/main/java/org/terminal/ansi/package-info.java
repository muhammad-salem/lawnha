/**

 * Many computer terminals and terminal emulators support colour and cursor control through 
 * a system of escape sequences. One such standard is commonly referred to as ANSI Colour. 
 * Several terminal specifications are based on the ANSI colour standard, including VT100.
 * The following is a partial listing of the VT100 control set. 
 * '< ESC >' represents the ASCII "escape" character, 0x1B. 
 * Bracketed tags represent modifiable decimal parameters; 
 * eg. {ROW} would be replaced by a row number.
